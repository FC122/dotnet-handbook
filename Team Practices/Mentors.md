Congrats to you too! Being a mentor means that you will get a chance to get to know your new colleagues better, discuss various topics and promote the team's values.
That being said, mentoring is not just simply answering questions and giving advice - it requires a set of skills such as listening, creativity, patience and willingness to learn from the person you mentor.
When preparing for your role, we advise checking out [this article](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/mentorship-skills).

### What does the mentoring process include?

#### Supporting colleagues

Support colleagues by providing answers to any questions related to task definition, acceptance criteria, and time tracking.

#### PR reviews

When reviewing colleague's PRs, try to avoid proposing solutions to problems and focus more on starting discussions. Colleagues should be guided to get to the best solution, that way they don't just get the answer, but also learn about the process of figuring out the answer and learn more about the topic itself. Minor things can be discussed in PR threads, but sometimes you will need to continue the discussion on a call to dive deeper into the topic. You should encourage this type of communication, as it has shown to be more productive and beneficial.

Examples:  

- __Lambda expression formatting issue.__ PR comment: Please check out the .Net code style formatting and format this section accordingly.
- __Invalid business logic rule, with missing tests.__ PR comment: Can you explain, what would happen in case API receives X value of param? How can we make sure we do not forget to check this use case?

### General guidelines and advice

* __Be open for discussion.__ Encourage your colleague to openly share their point of view, challenge their assumptions by asking questions and then share solutions providing examples.
* __Show that it is ok not to know__ and that it is the path of the learning process.
* __Encourage colleagues to approach other colleagues__ that are available to help when you are not. We are a team, and during onboarding collaboration with other team members should be promoted.
* __Give constructive feedback__, advice and propose additional resources if needed.
* __Communicate the progress__ of onboarding to your Team Lead.
