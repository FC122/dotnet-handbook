Postman is a great tool to test and work with APIs. It simplifies sharing API requests and their required parameters between people working on the project. 

For more information on how to use Postman, check [this great article by the QA team](https://infinum.com/handbook/qa/tools/using-postman).

#### Collaboration

Postman enables us to easily share our collections with our teammates through workspaces.

Sharing workspace is as easy as making workspace public and inviting people as collaborators. Unfortunately, in free plan we are limited by the number of people that can be added to the workspace to maximum of 4. That is something to think about when working with bigger teams.

One way to mitigate that is sharing the collections by manually exporting them and other teammates importing them in their own personal workspace. Main downfall with this approach is any changes made in original collection are not seen by others until new export/import is made.

#### Alternatives

Recently, we discovered a handy alternative to Postman tool in [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/). It is completely free and can be easily added as Chrome app. Interface resembles Postman and it behaves in a very similar manner. As an aditional feature it's possible to import Postman collections.
