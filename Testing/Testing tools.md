Tests in projects help us create stable applications and we should do them as a part of any project. While there are different kinds of tests, we mostly write unit and integration tests in .NET development. Tests are always written in a separate project.
We use [xUnit](https://xunit.net/) testing tool by default, along with [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq4) for mocking and [Fluent Assertions](https://fluentassertions.com/introduction) for building assertion rules. The tests are structured using the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern which helps us write readable and understandable code.
